/** @file flyweight.hpp
 * Single header with a templated implementation of the Flyweight design pattern
 *
 * Example of asset management using flyweight objects:
 * ```cpp
 * #include "flyweight.hpp"
 *
 * // 1. Declare your flyweight instance.
 * // The first template type is the key type.
 * // The second template type is the value type that will be created with the passed key.
 * // The third optional template type is the map type used to maintain the values, defaults to std::unordered_map.
 * // In this example, we're defining a resource manager for images.
 * flyweight::flyweight<std::string, Image> my_image_flyweight {
 *     // (optional) Pass a creator functor that will be called to create values.
 *     [](const std::string& image_name) {
 *         return LoadImage(image_name);
 *     },
 *     // (optional) Pass a deleter functor that will be called when values are released.
 *     [](Image& image) {
 *         UnloadImage(image);
 *     },
 * };
 *
 *
 * // 2. Get values from the flyweight.
 * // The first time the value will be created.
 * Image& image1 = my_image_flyweight.get("image1");
 * assert(my_image_flyweight.is_loaded("image1"));
 * // Subsequent gets will return the same reference to the same value.
 * Image& also_image1 = my_image_flyweight.get("image1");
 * assert(&image1 == &also_image1);
 *
 *
 * // 3. When you don't need values anymore, release them to the flyweight again.
 * my_image_flyweight.release("image1");
 * assert(!my_image_flyweight.is_loaded("image1"));
 * // Releasing a value that is not loaded is a harmless no-op.
 * my_image_flyweight.release("image that's not loaded");
 *
 *
 * // 4. (optional) Use RAII to automatically release a value by getting it with `get_autorelease`.
 * {
 *     auto autoreleased_image1 = my_image_flyweight.get_autorelease("image1");
 *     assert(my_image_flyweight.is_loaded("image1"));
 *     // Autoreleased values are simple wrappers to the original value reference.
 *     Image& image1 = autoreleased_image1;
 * }
 * // At this point "image1" was automatically released.
 * assert(!my_image_flyweight.is_loaded("image1"));
 * ```
